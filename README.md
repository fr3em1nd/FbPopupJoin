VanillaForums FbPopupJoin


Makes a popup for every visitor for the first time in the site to join your facebook community!

FbPopupJoin

This simple addon will create a quick and simple popup that shows once on every visitor prompting them to join your Facebook community. You can also set the days when the popup will expire and will save a small cookie to the client's computer to determine how many days the popup has last shown.

It's tested and proven working on my Self-hosted Vanilla Site http://www.txtmyt.org

Working On Vanilla 2.1

Feel free to improve it on GitHub:
